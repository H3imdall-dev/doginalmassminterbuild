this is a very early test made with my noob experience and grimoire
only built and tested on linux ubuntu at present

if you are testing you may need to go in and change the file source for the folder and modules 

open a terminal go to the modules direcoty

run modules on this order to see how the build is going
env.py
template_cloner.py
wallet_manager.py
master_funding.py

it doesnt completely work but im working on it
future commits to come 
just a Cow trying to code
