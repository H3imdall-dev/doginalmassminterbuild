this is a very early test made with my noob experience and grimoire
only built and tested on linux ubuntu at present


we need to arrange the files in a certain structutre 
make a folder called mass minter
put it on your desktop
inside that folder make directories for the following
cloned minters
minter
modules
in the minter folder place all files for the doginals minter everything apart 
from the .py modules and the .env 
put all the .py modules in the modules folder
leave the env in the main minter directory
if you are testing you may need to go in and change the file source for the folder and modules 

open a terminal go to the modules direcoty

run modules on this order to see how the build is going
env.py
template_cloner.py
wallet_manager.py
master_funding.py

it doesnt completely work but im working on it
future commits to come 
just a Cow trying to code
